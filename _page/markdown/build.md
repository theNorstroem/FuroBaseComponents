# The build process

We use the <a href="https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli">polymer-cli</a> 
toolchain by default.

Polymer CLI is the official command line tool for Polymer projects and Web Components. It includes a build pipeline, a boilerplate generator for creating elements and apps, a linter, a development server, and a test runner.

[Their documentation](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/apps/build-for-production) will give you a good starting point.
